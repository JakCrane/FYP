want to do smad style analysis at the start (but backwards)

possible use cases and applications



    repairing precise parts that need to be manufactured with a wide range of materials


    mass manufacturing for pieces like a moon base

    
    in situ resource utilisation










[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [10] uses fluidising powder bed or doesnt mention

[7] uses fluidising powder bed but drops the powder in at the diverging section of the nozzle?

cant use load cells or any mass in the control loop as no gravity

must be calibratable based on powder shape size and density on the fly






still need to answer what environment is best for cold spray
check [8] first

need to find out what powders and what powder sizes
mass flow rates of powder
velocities of powder
deposition rates




get ppt of current feed systems, look at benefits in space and then translate into space context
understand the correlation matrix to back up choice of why i would want to 
time isnt bottleneck quality is 
low to moderate particle size

make word document on what i wanted to do for the week, what i ended up doing and how i felt about the week
