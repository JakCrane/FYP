A fluidized bed-type powder feed system can achieve stable
delivery of powder propellant, but due to the complex structure of the
system, it is not conducive to the integration of powder engine systems
and lightweight applications.

The powder feed system of motor driven piston has obvious advantages for piston motion stability regulation, but the system putsforward high requirements for motor power. Especially when the pressure in the storage tank is high, it is difficult for the motor to push thepiston and thus the piston motion speed is difficult to regulate if an equalpressure balance is not taken. At the same time, since the piston isdirectly connected to the motor rod, it will increase the length of thepowder feed system accordingly, which is not beneficial to system integration.
Although the powder feed system of the pneumatic drive piston ismore complex in terms of gas circuit design, it can achieve piston speedregulation by adjusting the amount of driving gas and fluidizing gas. Thedriving gas and fluidizing gas can share a common gas source, withoutthe need for an additional piston drive device. When the pressure difference between the drive chamber and the fluidization chamber isgreater than the combined resistance, the piston could be motivated.Moreover, the piston guide rod can be removed in this way, and thesystem is more integrated. It can be seen that the powder feeding systemof the pneumatic drive piston is more suitable for powder fueled ramjets,and further research needs to focus on the accurate regulation of thepressure of fluidized gas and drive gas.
