load cell to calculate feedrate which isnt possible in 0g
dont understand how exactly it works

requires gravity for the powder to sit in annular groove

dont want to use liquid as it will increase mass to orbit

assuming smooth movement of piston then would work. need to check particle size and if it was ever used

would need some way to push the powder down but apparently is easy to control flow with control of speed of rotating screw

seems to be an intermediate between fluidised and screw/mechanical

generalised form of the oerlikon one

![alt text](/Research_FIles/October/vibrational_feed.png)

interesting concept but relies on gravity to work
