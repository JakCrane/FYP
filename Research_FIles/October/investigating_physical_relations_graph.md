need to be checked with Ajit ***

particle diameter is inversely correlated with particle velocity as diameter will be positively correlated with mass therefore will be harder to accelerate bigger particles

particle diameter is inversely correlated with deposit hardness as
    hardness = materials resistance to plastic deformation

particle diameter is inversely correlated with porosity as 
    porosity = space left over so les porosity means les gaps
