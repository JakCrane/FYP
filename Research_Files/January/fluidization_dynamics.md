i have found a few books on the theory behind fluidisation.
the first one im reviewing is fluidisation dynamics by gibilaro

simplest theory is single particle suspension
    first concept talked of is unhindered minimal settling velocity as well as Re_p (referred to until mentioned as Re) = d_particle U_flow rho_flow / mu_flow

    the creeping regime for this is the limiting case in which the flow is slow (but still fast enough to make the particle float) and follows perfectly around a spherical particle
        it occurs at Re < 0.1 and is the common use case for industrial powderbeds
        for this regime you can integrate the buoyancy force and drag force over the particle and match it with gravity to get a compact form

        everything acts relatively linearly and you can find the drag coefficient of the bed to be 24/Re
    
    the next fastest is inertial flow regime and is for Re > 500
        cd is constant at 0.44 for this region and only until Re > 100,000 does this change where Cd sharply falls but this is outside the range of fluidisation relevence

    dallavalle has a relation that works for all flow regimes to relate Cd to particle reynolds number
    
if suspending a single particle is the limiting case of high velocity the limiting case of low velocity is gas being passed through a bed of particles with all particles still being in contact with one another
as the fluid flows through the particles it loses pressure faster than or just equally as fast as the increase in gravitational potential energy. no drag because of no movement so it is the limiting balance of buoyancy and gravity
