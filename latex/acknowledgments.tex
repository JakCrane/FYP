First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr Ajit Panesar for allowing me to support with testing of the original COSMOS project and then taking on my self-proposed project. His advice and support on the project was invaluable. Secondly, I would like to thank the technicians at the Advanced Hackspace for training me on the lathe and advising me on o-ring groove sizing. I would also like to tank the aeronautics technicians at imperial as they provided insight into the most effective way to set up my experiments.
