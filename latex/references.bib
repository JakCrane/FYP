abstract = {This paper reports on the development of a novel freeform fabrication technique using a cold spray (CS) system. In the CS process, metallic powder particles are accelerated in a supersonic gas jet and impacted with a substrate at speeds in excess of 600m/s. The non-melting nature of its deposition mechanism ensures that the sprayed material is free from thermally induced tensile stresses, while the underlying substrate remains unchanged. The process is seen as a viable method for additive manufacturing because of its high deposition rates and controllable spray jet. A process was developed to investigate the potential of non-thermal freeform fabrication and was coined Cold Gas Dynamic Manufacturing (CGDM). Here, additive and subtractive techniques were combined to enable the production of complex geometries. Whereas most CS facilities concentrate on the application of wear or corrosion-resistant coatings, CGDM is dedicated to the production of freeform components, whilst still retaining an inherent coating ability. The process can produce functional forms using novel manufacturing strategies that are unique to CS. This paper presents information on the process, and details the various strategies employed during component fabrication. It was possible to construct components from many materials, including titanium, which exhibited freeform surfaces, internal channels and embedded devices. A breakdown of the process economics is also provided, with and without helium recycling.}

In this chapter, a brief outline of AM and its challenges in processing are discussed. The present state of metal and alloy AM is also presented. In particular, the challenges in the additive manufacturing of metals and alloys are discussed in detail. It reviews the challenges in the additive manufacturing process of metals and alloys including how rapidly changing conditions during AM process influence metals and alloys microstructure development. A deeper understanding of AM metal solidification and solid-state phase transitions is needed to process the additive manufacturing of metals and alloys and to control their microstructures. It also discusses other common problems in the AM process of metals and alloys. This work provides a direction for scientific research to enable the production of high performance AM metallic parts of reliably high-quality microstructures and mechanical properties.",

Experiments presented that, the bubble dome and vortex would generate AE signals with different shapes when passing through the waveguide, which could be further used to precisely detect the bubble sizes and velocities both in pseudo-two-dimensional and three-dimensional fluidized beds. Compared with results from pressure fluctuations, bubble sizes measured by AE methods in three-dimensional fluidized beds were more consistent with empirical formulas results and displayed similar robustness. Furthermore, the measured bubble distributions demonstrated that bubbles tended to rise along an annular zone in the cross-section of the fluidized bed, and the annular zone shrank with the increasing height due to the net inward movement of bubbles. Under high gas velocities, the annular zone would shrink until reaching the centerline, while under low gas velocities, a steady annular zone existed at a certain radial position.}

In this paper, the feeding of powder in powder engines at different gas-solid ratios was experimentally investigated. Working characteristics of the classic piston-driven powder feeding system were obtained. A high linear tendency between powder mass flow rate and the minimum throttle channel area is observed from the experiment. The solid-gas mass ratio to maintain a stable powder feeding is approximately valued in range of 34.4–54.6 under different throttle channel areas. The least deviation in the relative powder mass flow rate for the tests is −15% to +8%. Due to the high uncertainty of the gas-solid flow structures at different gas-solid ratios, obvious low-frequency oscillations and high-frequency oscillations exist during the powder feeding process. The frequencies of low-frequency oscillations are mainly 1–3 Hz, while those of high-frequency oscillations are 20–30 Hz and 30–45 Hz in different tests.}

ABSTRACT = {The physical properties of Ti6Al4V powder affect the spreadability of the powder and uniformity of the powder bed, which had a great impact on the performance of built parts made by powder bed fusion technology. Micro-computed tomography is a well-established technique used to analyze the non-destructivity of the objects’ interior. Ti6Al4V powders were scanned with micro-CT to show the internal and external information of all the particles. The morphology, particle size distribution, hollow particle ratio, density, inclusion, and specific surface area of the powder samples were quantitatively characterized, and the relationship of flowability with these physical properties was analyzed in this work. The research results of this article showed that micro-CT is an effective way to characterize these items, and can be developed as a standard method of powder physical properties in the future.},

abstract = {When metallic microparticles impact substrates at high enough velocity, they bond cohesively. It has been widely argued that this critical adhesion velocity is associated with the impact velocity required to induce adiabatic shear instability. Here, we argue that the large interfacial strain needed to achieve bonding does not necessarily require adiabatic shear instability to trigger. Instead, we suggest that the interaction of strong pressure waves with the free surface at the particle edges—a natural dynamic effect of a sufficiently rapid impact—can cause hydrodynamic plasticity that effects bonding, without requiring shear instability. We proceed on this basis to postulate and confirm a proportionality between critical velocity and the bulk speed of sound, which supports the viewpoint that shear instability is not the mechanism of adhesion in cold spray.}

abstract = {The metallurgical bonding of cold spraying is investigated from the perspective of plastic deformation. The individual Al particle was deposited on the surface of Ni substrate by low-pressure cold spraying technology. Direct observation of the Al/Ni interface from the cross-sectional morphology shows that metallurgical bonding occurs only at the partial Al/Ni interface. The finite element simulation considering the presence of oxide layer confirms that the metallurgical bonding is located in front of the maximum plastic deformation area. In the maximum plastic deformation area, the relative displacement between Al particle and Ni substrate exists from the beginning of contact to the end of deposition, which makes the metallurgical bonding discontinuous and gradually disappear.}

ABSTRACT = {Aluminum target material is an important target material and is widely used in preparations of semiconductor films, integrated circuits, display circuits, protective films, decorative films, etc. In this study, pure aluminum coatings were deposited on stainless steel substrates by cold-spray technology as part of an overall project to produce large-size pure aluminum sputtering target materials. The results show that pure aluminum coatings exhibit high adhesive strength (~98 MPa), high deposition efficiency (~95%), and low porosity (~0.3%) on stainless steel substrates. The bonding mechanisms of pure aluminum coatings on stainless steel are a combination of metallurgical and mechanical interlocking. The evolutions of microstructure and mechanical properties of pure aluminum coatings under different heat treatments were also studied. With the increase of heat treatment temperature, it is found that cold-sprayed aluminum coatings become more homogenous in microstructure, the microhardness is reduced, and the adhesive strength seems to be slightly reduced. Overall, this study demonstrates significant advantages of cold-spray technology in depositing high-performance pure aluminum coatings on stainless steels.},
