abstract = {This paper reports on the development of a novel freeform fabrication technique using a cold spray (CS) system. In the CS process, metallic powder particles are accelerated in a supersonic gas jet and impacted with a substrate at speeds in excess of 600m/s. The non-melting nature of its deposition mechanism ensures that the sprayed material is free from thermally induced tensile stresses, while the underlying substrate remains unchanged. The process is seen as a viable method for additive manufacturing because of its high deposition rates and controllable spray jet. A process was developed to investigate the potential of non-thermal freeform fabrication and was coined Cold Gas Dynamic Manufacturing (CGDM). Here, additive and subtractive techniques were combined to enable the production of complex geometries. Whereas most CS facilities concentrate on the application of wear or corrosion-resistant coatings, CGDM is dedicated to the production of freeform components, whilst still retaining an inherent coating ability. The process can produce functional forms using novel manufacturing strategies that are unique to CS. This paper presents information on the process, and details the various strategies employed during component fabrication. It was possible to construct components from many materials, including titanium, which exhibited freeform surfaces, internal channels and embedded devices. A breakdown of the process economics is also provided, with and without helium recycling.}

abstract="Additive Manufacturing (AM) not only allows the component production with complex shapes, also offers the openings of control of microstructures and design of materials for metals and alloys. The fundamental concepts of additive manufacturing and its growth is to be evaluated since this field is growing rapidly. In this chapter, a brief outline of AM and its challenges in processing are discussed. The present state of metal and alloy AM is also presented. In particular, the challenges in the additive manufacturing of metals and alloys are discussed in detail. It reviews the challenges in the additive manufacturing process of metals and alloys including how rapidly changing conditions during AM process influence metals and alloys microstructure development. A deeper understanding of AM metal solidification and solid-state phase transitions is needed to process the additive manufacturing of metals and alloys and to control their microstructures. It also discusses other common problems in the AM process of metals and alloys. This work provides a direction for scientific research to enable the production of high performance AM metallic parts of reliably high-quality microstructures and mechanical properties.",
