abstract = {This paper reports on the development of a novel freeform fabrication technique using a cold spray (CS) system. In the CS process, metallic powder particles are accelerated in a supersonic gas jet and impacted with a substrate at speeds in excess of 600m/s. The non-melting nature of its deposition mechanism ensures that the sprayed material is free from thermally induced tensile stresses, while the underlying substrate remains unchanged. The process is seen as a viable method for additive manufacturing because of its high deposition rates and controllable spray jet. A process was developed to investigate the potential of non-thermal freeform fabrication and was coined Cold Gas Dynamic Manufacturing (CGDM). Here, additive and subtractive techniques were combined to enable the production of complex geometries. Whereas most CS facilities concentrate on the application of wear or corrosion-resistant coatings, CGDM is dedicated to the production of freeform components, whilst still retaining an inherent coating ability. The process can produce functional forms using novel manufacturing strategies that are unique to CS. This paper presents information on the process, and details the various strategies employed during component fabrication. It was possible to construct components from many materials, including titanium, which exhibited freeform surfaces, internal channels and embedded devices. A breakdown of the process economics is also provided, with and without helium recycling.}

Experiments presented that, the bubble dome and vortex would generate AE signals with different shapes when passing through the waveguide, which could be further used to precisely detect the bubble sizes and velocities both in pseudo-two-dimensional and three-dimensional fluidized beds. Compared with results from pressure fluctuations, bubble sizes measured by AE methods in three-dimensional fluidized beds were more consistent with empirical formulas results and displayed similar robustness. Furthermore, the measured bubble distributions demonstrated that bubbles tended to rise along an annular zone in the cross-section of the fluidized bed, and the annular zone shrank with the increasing height due to the net inward movement of bubbles. Under high gas velocities, the annular zone would shrink until reaching the centerline, while under low gas velocities, a steady annular zone existed at a certain radial position.}

In this paper, the feeding of powder in powder engines at different gas-solid ratios was experimentally investigated. Working characteristics of the classic piston-driven powder feeding system were obtained. A high linear tendency between powder mass flow rate and the minimum throttle channel area is observed from the experiment. The solid-gas mass ratio to maintain a stable powder feeding is approximately valued in range of 34.4–54.6 under different throttle channel areas. The least deviation in the relative powder mass flow rate for the tests is −15% to +8%. Due to the high uncertainty of the gas-solid flow structures at different gas-solid ratios, obvious low-frequency oscillations and high-frequency oscillations exist during the powder feeding process. The frequencies of low-frequency oscillations are mainly 1–3 Hz, while those of high-frequency oscillations are 20–30 Hz and 30–45 Hz in different tests.}

ABSTRACT = {The physical properties of Ti6Al4V powder affect the spreadability of the powder and uniformity of the powder bed, which had a great impact on the performance of built parts made by powder bed fusion technology. Micro-computed tomography is a well-established technique used to analyze the non-destructivity of the objects’ interior. Ti6Al4V powders were scanned with micro-CT to show the internal and external information of all the particles. The morphology, particle size distribution, hollow particle ratio, density, inclusion, and specific surface area of the powder samples were quantitatively characterized, and the relationship of flowability with these physical properties was analyzed in this work. The research results of this article showed that micro-CT is an effective way to characterize these items, and can be developed as a standard method of powder physical properties in the future.},

abstract = {When metallic microparticles impact substrates at high enough velocity, they bond cohesively. It has been widely argued that this critical adhesion velocity is associated with the impact velocity required to induce adiabatic shear instability. Here, we argue that the large interfacial strain needed to achieve bonding does not necessarily require adiabatic shear instability to trigger. Instead, we suggest that the interaction of strong pressure waves with the free surface at the particle edges—a natural dynamic effect of a sufficiently rapid impact—can cause hydrodynamic plasticity that effects bonding, without requiring shear instability. We proceed on this basis to postulate and confirm a proportionality between critical velocity and the bulk speed of sound, which supports the viewpoint that shear instability is not the mechanism of adhesion in cold spray.}

abstract = {The metallurgical bonding of cold spraying is investigated from the perspective of plastic deformation. The individual Al particle was deposited on the surface of Ni substrate by low-pressure cold spraying technology. Direct observation of the Al/Ni interface from the cross-sectional morphology shows that metallurgical bonding occurs only at the partial Al/Ni interface. The finite element simulation considering the presence of oxide layer confirms that the metallurgical bonding is located in front of the maximum plastic deformation area. In the maximum plastic deformation area, the relative displacement between Al particle and Ni substrate exists from the beginning of contact to the end of deposition, which makes the metallurgical bonding discontinuous and gradually disappear.}

ABSTRACT = {Aluminum target material is an important target material and is widely used in preparations of semiconductor films, integrated circuits, display circuits, protective films, decorative films, etc. In this study, pure aluminum coatings were deposited on stainless steel substrates by cold-spray technology as part of an overall project to produce large-size pure aluminum sputtering target materials. The results show that pure aluminum coatings exhibit high adhesive strength (~98 MPa), high deposition efficiency (~95%), and low porosity (~0.3%) on stainless steel substrates. The bonding mechanisms of pure aluminum coatings on stainless steel are a combination of metallurgical and mechanical interlocking. The evolutions of microstructure and mechanical properties of pure aluminum coatings under different heat treatments were also studied. With the increase of heat treatment temperature, it is found that cold-sprayed aluminum coatings become more homogenous in microstructure, the microhardness is reduced, and the adhesive strength seems to be slightly reduced. Overall, this study demonstrates significant advantages of cold-spray technology in depositing high-performance pure aluminum coatings on stainless steels.},

abstract = {Stable and efficient powder propellant feeding is the key to the excellent performance of powder engines, but the previous structures of supply systems pose a challenge to it. Therefore, structural optimization has been made for the powder propellant supply system to promote feeding. Specifically, the traditional sealed piston is optimized as the gas-permeable piston that has an annular gap between the piston edge and the silo wall to allow the driving gas to permeate into the powder column, producing the gas pressure gradient to increase powder axial pressure and leading to the cancellation of fluidization gas line at the front of the silo to reduce gas turbulence and powder fluctuations. There is a discovery that the powder achieves mass flow under only airflow and discharged powder amount can be maximized as much as possible by combining with gas-permeable piston, which also supports the feasibility of the optimized system and realizes a more stable and higher flux flow. In addition, the gas-permeable piston with a gear-shaped end face has the best overall performance. Through this work, we wish that our research can provide valuable guidance for the design of powder propellant supply systems to meet the requirements of spacecraft power systems.}

abstract = {The handling and storage of bulk powders is common in many industries such as detergent, pharmaceutical, bulk chemical and food. A lot of materials are susceptible to changes with time that may lead to bulk powder caking, resulting in an unmanageable powder and process downtime, which impacts upon profitability. In this review the current state of the art related to powder caking is explored. The relevant interparticle interactions are discussed with respect to elastic and plastic deformations and the development of liquid and solid bridges due to capillary condensation, sintering and solvent evaporation. The environmental, i.e. temperature and humidity, and the mechanical conditions can heavily influence the transformation of a bulk powder and a number of studies are available that attempt to relate these conditions to caking. A significant amount of work related to the caking behaviour of amorphous powders is available in the literature. Amorphous materials are susceptible to caking due to environmental conditions influencing the glass transition temperature. Once the temperature of amorphous powders exceeds the glass transition, viscous flow occurs and cake strength increases. Crystalline solids may undergo transformations leading to caking. It can take a considerable time and cyclic environmental conditions for caking to occur. However, little research focuses on cyclic conditions and there is limited predictive capability. Finally the options available for attempting to reduce caking propensity are briefly covered and a section that discusses the available caking test methods is given.}

abstract = {Powder bed fusion methods of additive manufacturing (AM) require consistent, reproducible, and uniform layers of powder for the reliable production of high-quality parts, where properties of powder are central to achieving this. Among these properties, powder flowability and spreadability play critical roles in determining the quality of these powder layers. While extensive research has been conducted on powder flow and spreading behaviour, and on their characterisation, there is little critical comparison and review of these terms in the context of AM. Such a review is necessary to further develop and enhance our comprehension of spreading dynamics and its relation to powder properties in AM systems. This review paper aims to build a coherent understanding of the correlation between powder characteristics and spreading in powder based additive manufacturing and its impact on manufactured parts. It highlights the current progress in comprehending spreading dynamics, the influence of powder characteristics, environmental conditions, spreading system, and the development of testing tools to assess powder spreadability. Furthermore, the paper critically discusses the challenge of finding appropriate quantitative metrics and recent advances in the use of standardised methods for evaluating powder spreadability.}

A spouted fluidized bed experiment rig was established to carry out the high-speed imaging experiment and validate the numerical results. All three drag models could basically describe the transient behavior of the bubble shape. In the first stage of whole fluidization process{,} Syamal-O{'}Brien drag model could predict well both the change of the bubble diameter and the bubble shape in good agreement with experiment results{,} but the model for the bubble collapse status is not a good prediction; Wen-Yu drag model underestimates the variations in bubble diameter and predicts the occurrence of the next fluidization stage prematurely; although{,} the Gidaspow drag model still slightly underestimates the change of bubble diameter{,} but the results of this drag model are in good agreement with the experiment results in terms of the bubble shape{,} and pressure fluctuations. Under the architecture of CFD/DEM{,} the Gidaspow drag model gives the better prediction of the inner flow in the dense gas–solid fluidized bed.

abstract = {This review article aims to provide a comprehensive and understandable account of the theoretical foundation, modeling issues, and numerical implementation of the Lagrangian–Eulerian (LE) approach for multiphase flows. The LE approach is based on a statistical description of the dispersed phase in terms of a stochastic point process that is coupled with a Eulerian statistical representation of the carrier fluid phase. A modeled transport equation for the particle distribution function — also known as Williams' spray equation in the case of sprays — is indirectly solved using a Lagrangian particle method. Interphase transfer of mass, momentum and energy are represented by coupling terms that appear in the Eulerian conservation equations for the fluid phase. This theoretical foundation is then used to develop LE sub-models for interphase interactions such as momentum transfer. Every LE model implies a corresponding closure in the Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid theory, and these moment equations are derived. Approaches to incorporate multiscale interactions between particles (or spray droplets) and turbulent eddies in the carrier gas that result in better predictions of particle (or droplet) dispersion are described. Numerical convergence of LE implementations is shown to be crucial to the success of the LE modeling approach. It is shown how numerical convergence and accuracy of an LE implementation can be established using grid-free estimators and computational particle number density control algorithms. This review of recent advances establishes that LE methods can be used to solve multiphase flow problems of practical interest, provided sub-models are implemented using numerically convergent algorithms. These insights also provide the foundation for further development of Lagrangian methods for multiphase flows. Extensions to the LE method that can account for neighbor particle interactions and preferential concentration of particles in turbulence are outlined.}

ABSTRACT = {Ni-based superalloys have been extensively employed in the aerospace field because of their excellent thermal and mechanical stabilities at high temperatures. With these advantages, many sought to study the influence of fusion-reliant additive manufacturing (AM) techniques for part fabrication/reparation. However, their fabrication presents many problems related to the melting and solidification defects from the feedstock material. Such defects consist of oxidation, inclusions, hot tearing, cracking, and elemental segregation. Consequentially, these defects created a need to discover an AM technique that can mitigate these disadvantages. The cold spray (CS) process is one additive technique that can mitigate these issues. This is largely due to its cost-effectiveness, low temperature, and fast and clean deposition process. However, its effectiveness for Ni-based superalloy fabrication and its structural performance has yet to be determined. This review aimed to fill this knowledge gap in two different ways. First, the advantages of CS technology for Ni-based superalloys compared with thermal-reliant AM techniques are briefly discussed. Second, the processing–structure–property relationships of these deposits are elucidated from microstructural, mechanical, and tribological (from low to high temperatures) perspectives. Considering the porous and brittle defects of CS coatings, a comprehensive review of the post-processing techniques for CS-fabricated Ni superalloys is also introduced. Based on this knowledge, the key structure-property mechanisms of CS Ni superalloys are elucidated with suggestions on how knowledge gaps in the field can be filled in the near future.},
