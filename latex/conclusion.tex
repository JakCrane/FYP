This report set out to investigate the behaviour of fluidised powder feed systems for in-space additive manufacturing. Building on previous work analysing cold spray additive manufacturing, a subsystem of the cold spray process was disected and areas of improvement were analysed.

Experimental data found mass flow rates of up to 60 g/s can be found with


This report has demonstrated that pneumatic powder feed systems are a promising option for CSAM in space. Inadvertently, the scalability of this design paradigm has been well demonstrated allowing for CSAM to be a strong candidate method to build large structures like habitats or solar arrays in space.
